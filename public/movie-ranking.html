<p>I love this movie from the first time I've watched it until today. The story from the very beginning up until the end was so beautiful.</p>

<h3>Tiyanak</h3>
<p>It is a horror movie about an aborted child and became a child demon. It scare the hell out of me from the first time I have watch it until today it still gives me the creeps.</p>

<h3>Benjamin Button</h3>
<p>It is one of my favorite movie of all time. It is a story about a child born look so old and die as he became look new born. The story goes as the protagonist have a rare condition which he started so old and as he grows older he became younger and younger until he became a baby.</p>
